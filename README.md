# Verilog-Design-and-Verification-Projects
Welcome to the Verilog Design and Verification Repository!
This repository contains a collection of RTL design modules and their corresponding testbenches for simulation and verification using Verilog HDL. It is aimed at learners, students, and professionals interested in digital design, functional verification, and FPGA/ASIC development workflows.

🧠 What You'll Find Here

✅ Design Modules:

>A wide range of combinational and sequential logic designs, including:

>Adders, Multiplexers, Encoders, Decoders

>Flip-flops, Counters, FSMs

>ALU designs, Memory units, etc.

🔍 Verification Testbenches:

 Each design includes a simulation testbench that:

>Generates stimulus (inputs)

>Checks functional correctness of the design

>Displays waveform and output verification

🧪 Simulation Ready:

 Compatible with tools like:

>ModelSim, Vivado Simulator, Icarus Verilog, or EDA Playground

🎯 Goals of This Repository

>Practice and improve Verilog coding skills

>Demonstrate RTL design with modular, reusable code

>Strengthen verification skills with proper testbenches

>Provide a solid base for project-based learning or interview prep
